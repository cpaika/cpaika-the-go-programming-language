### The Go Programming Language
This repository is a record of my progress through my copy of ["The Go Programming Language"](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440).  Each top level folder corresponds to a chapter of the book, with subfolders for the subsection of the chapter.

Note that any comments in the code are for my personal understanding as I went through the exercises.

To run any exercise:
1.  Install Golang on your computer.  On Mac or Linux, you can install Go via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install golang
```
2.  Execute any of the completed exercises, for example:
```bash
go run chapter-one/1-hello-world/hello-world.go
```
