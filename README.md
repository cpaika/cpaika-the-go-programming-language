### The Go Programming Language
This repository is charting my progress through my copy of ["The Go Programming Language"](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440).  Each top level folder corresponds to a chapter of the book.

To run any exercise:
1.  Install Golang on your computer
For example on Mac via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
`brew install golang`
2.  Execute any of the exercises
For example `go run chapter-one/1-hello-world/hello-world.go`
